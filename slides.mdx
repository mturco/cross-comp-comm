# Cross Component Communication

<Notes>
  So today I'm going to be talking about cross component
  communication
  <hr />
  Or really just how components talk to each other
  <hr />
  React provides us with a number of APIs for communicating
  between components
  <hr />
  Each of those APIs have their own specific use cases but also
  their own shortcomings
  <hr />
  At Namely, we've encountered some of these shortcomings while
  working on some of our more complicated design system
  components
  <hr />
  So I thought I'd share today some of the issues we've
  encountered and the patterns we created to work around them
</Notes>

---

# Let's review our options

<Notes>
  But first, let's review our options
  <hr />
  Just so we're all on the same page
</Notes>

---

## 1. Props

```jsx
<Greeting subject="World" />
// ↓
<p>Hello, {subject}!</p>
```

<Notes>
  Props are the simplest way to pass data between components in
  React and really most frontend frameworks
  <hr />
  They should be the first option we reach for because they
  introduce the least complexity
  <hr />
  Keeping complexity low is important because it keeps code easy
  to read, test, and debug
</Notes>

---

## 2. Render Props

```jsx
// React Router
<Route path="/home" render={() => <h1>Home</h1>} />

// React PowerPlug
<Toggle initial={false}>
  {({ on, toggle }) => (
    <Checkbox onClick={toggle} checked={on} />
  )}
</Toggle>
```

<Notes>
  Another option we have for passing data between components is
  render props
  <hr />
  Render props are simply function props that return JSX for the
  component to render
  <hr />
  So we have 2 examples here from popular React libraries of
  components that use render props
  <hr />
  The first one, from React Router, uses a prop literally called
  render
  <hr />
  The second one, React PowerPlug, uses the children prop as its
  render prop because of the shorter syntax in React
  <hr />
  Using children as the render prop is very common for this
  reason
  <hr />
  Notice that it's also passing two properties in the render prop
  function. This is really where most of the usefulness of this
  approach comes in.
</Notes>

---

## 3. Refs

```jsx
const ref = useRef();

useEffect(() => {
  ref.current.focus();
}, []);

return <Input ref={ref} />;
```

<Notes>
  Refs allow us to the access DOM nodes that React renders to the
  browser
  <hr />
  This can be useful to do things like focus management, getting
  an element's dimesions, or directly manipulating the DOM
  <hr />
  Refs can also be used for many other things though
  <hr />
  In functional components they can be used as instance variables
  to store data between renders
  <hr />
  And, as we'll see later, they can also be used to pass data
  between components
</Notes>

---

## 4. Context

```jsx
<ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
  ...
    <Button />
```

```jsx
const Button = props => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button {...props} className={theme} />;
};
```

<Notes>
  Lastly, we have context
  <hr />
  Context works by passing a value to a provider component
  <hr />
  Anything rendered under this provider in the component tree can
  then consume this value using the useContext hook
  <hr />
  The use case example that always seems to be given for context
  is theming
  <hr />
  So here we have a theme provider that's passing some theme data
  to a button component. The button component is then customizing
  its appearance based on the theme data.
  <hr />
  This example gets the point across but, as we'll see in the
  next few minutes, context can be used for many different
  scenarios and can often simplify the API of our components.
</Notes>

---

# We have some good options

1. Props
2. Render Props
3. Refs
4. Context

...but sometimes things still get messy

<Notes>
  So we have some good options for passing data around in our
  applications
  <hr />
  But things can still sometimes get messy
  <hr />
  We can find ourselves prop drilling, creating awkward
  abstractions, or just generally writing components that are
  hard to test
  <hr />
  So let's look at some patterns to help avoid these issues
</Notes>

---

# Useful Patterns

<Patterns active={1} patterns={patterns} />
<Notes>
  So we're going to talk about 4 different patterns today
</Notes>

---

### Problem: Prop drilling

```jsx
<App userName="Toby Flenderson" />
// ↓
<Dashboard userName={userName} />
// ↓
<DashboardHeader userName={userName} />
// ↓
<UserGreeting userName={userName} />
// ↓
<p>Welcome back, {userName}!</p>
```

<Notes>
  Sometimes we need to pass data down through several layers of
  components in our application
  <hr />
  If we did this using props, we'd need to add a prop to every
  component in the tree all the way down to the actual consumer
  <hr />
  This is often referred to as "prop drilling" and, while it
  works, it has some downsides
  <hr />
  Redundant code
  <hr />
  API changes are noisy
  <hr />
  Violates separation of concerns - 3 of these these components
  aren't actually using this data, they're just passing it along.
  This makes their API less clear and forces us to write
  unnecessary tests.
</Notes>

---

### Solution: Use context

```jsx
const UserContext = React.createContext(null);
```

```jsx
<UserContext.Provider value={user}>
  <App>
    <Dashboard>
      <DashboardHeader>
        <UserGreeting />
        ...
```

<Notes>
  One way to solve this is by using app level context
  <hr />
  If many parts of our application need to access data about the
  user, it might make sense to pass the user data to a context
  provider at the root app level
  <hr />
  That allows us to remove all of the redundant props and only
  pass the user data once
  <hr />
  Any component that needs access to this data can individually
  choose to consume that information
</Notes>

---

### Solution: Use context (cont)

```jsx
const UserGreeting = () => {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  return <p>Welcome back, {user.name}!</p>;
};
```

<Notes>
  If we take a look at the UserGreeting component we see that
  it's simply consuming the UserContext we defined on the
  previous slide
  <hr />
  There is one thing worth calling out here though. One of the
  benefits of functional components in React is that they are
  inherently pure functions, meaning that given the same input,
  they always return the same output.
  <hr />
  That becomes no longer true for this component now that it's
  consuming our user context. That's not necessarily a bad thing
  but it does make this component slightly more complex.
  <hr />
  It's worth pointing out that we probably don't want to connect
  too many simple presentation components to context like this.
  If we do have a situation where that would be necessary, it
  might be better to have a single parent component that consumes
  the context and passes the data down to these presentational
  components.
</Notes>

---

# Useful Patterns

<Patterns active={2} patterns={patterns} />

---

### Problem: Repeated props

```jsx
<RadioButton name="color" value="red" checked={color === 'red'} />
<RadioButton name="color" value="green" checked={color === 'green'} />
<RadioButton name="color" value="blue" checked={color === 'blue'} />
<RadioButton name="color" value="yellow" checked={color === 'yellow'} />
<RadioButton name="color" value="purple" checked={color === 'purple'} />
<RadioButton name="color" value="orange" checked={color === 'orange'} />
```

The only distinct data here is each radio's `value`

<Notes>
  So how many of you have seen code that looks like this before?
  I'd be willing to bet most of us have
  <hr />
  The way native radio buttons work requires that we repeat the
  group name "color" for each radio button
  <hr />
  Worse than that is the fact that the logic for the checked prop
  is being repeated for each radio button as well
  <hr />
  So what do we do about this?
</Notes>

---

### Solution: RadioGroup component that uses context

```jsx
<RadioGroup name="color" selectedValue={color}>
  <RadioButton value="red" />
  <RadioButton value="green" />
  <RadioButton value="blue" />
  <RadioButton value="yellow" />
  <RadioButton value="purple" />
  <RadioButton value="orange" />
</RadioGroup>
```

Now all common data is passed to `RadioGroup`

<Notes>
  One solution would be to introduce a RadioGroup component that
  takes name and selectedValue props and passes them down to our
  RadioButton components via context
  <hr />
  You can see that this cleans up the API really nicely because
  all of the repeated data is now only passed once to the parent
  component and the radio buttons are only being passed their own
  distinct values
</Notes>

---

### Solution: RadioGroup component that uses context (cont)

```jsx
const RadioGroup = ({ children, name, selectedValue }) => {
  const context = useMemo(() => ({ name, selectedValue }), [
    name,
    selectedValue
  ]);

  return (
    <RadioGroupContext.Provider value={context}>
      {children}
    </RadioGroupContext>
  );
};
```

<Notes>
  If we take a look at the RadioGroup component, we see that it's
  really just passing along name and selectedValue to a context
  provider
  <hr />
  Note that we're using useMemo here to avoid creating a new
  object instance on every render
</Notes>

---

### Solution: RadioGroup component that uses context (cont)

```jsx
const RadioButton = ({ value }) => {
  const { name, selectedValue } = useContext(RadioGroupContext);

  return (
    <input
      type="radio"
      name={name}
      value={value}
      checked={value === selectedValue}
    />
  );
};
```

<Notes>
  Next let's take a look at the RadioButton component
  <hr />
  It's also very simple
  <hr />
  It's essentially just consuming the context from the last slide
  and passing along the data to the input here
</Notes>

---

### Taking it a step further

```jsx
<SelectionGroup name="sizes" selectedValue={sizes}>
  <Checkbox value="small" />
  <Checkbox value="medium" />
  <Checkbox value="large" />
</SelectionGroup>
```

<Notes>
  The nice thing about this abstraction is that it is super
  reusable
  <hr />
  In this example, we could rename RadioGroup to SelectionGroup
  and allow it to be used with checkboxes as well
  <hr />
  With a slightly different change event handler, we could
  implement this without any API changes
  <hr />
  At Namely, we've taken this idea and run with it a bit. In
  fact, we took this same pattern and used it to build an
  abstraction that handles form state management for us.
</Notes>

---

### Instead of this...

```jsx
<Input name="firstName" value={firstName}
  onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />

<Input name="lastName" value={lastName}
  onChange={handleLastNameChange} />

<Input name="email" value={email}
  onChange={handleEmailChange} />

<Input name="password" value={password}
  onChange={handlePasswordChange} />

<Button onClick={registerUser}>Register</Button>
```

<Notes>
  So instead of writing code that looks like this where we are
  manually setting the value and change handler for each input
</Notes>

---

### We can do this

```jsx
<Form onSubmit={registerUser}>
  <Input name="firstName" />
  <Input name="lastName" />
  <Input name="email" />
  <Input name="password" />
  <Button type="submit">Register</Button>
</Form>
```

<Notes>
  We can write code that looks like this
  <hr />
  This works because the Form component here is automatically
  managing the state of these inputs using their names
  <hr />
  It automatically listens for change events, internally updates
  the state, and then sets the current value on each input
</Notes>

---

# Useful Patterns

<Patterns active={3} patterns={patterns} />

---

### Problem: Data provided by render props has a limited scope

```jsx
<Form>
  {({ values, handleChange }) => (
    <>
      <Input
        name="name"
        value={values.name}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <Input
        name="email"
        value={values.email}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </>
  )}
</Form>
```

<Notes>
  Sticking with the form example, let's imagine that we have a
  Form component that does some basic state management for us
  <hr />
  For the sake of the example, let's pretend we don't have that
  fancy context-connected form component
  <hr />
  So this form uses a render prop to pass us the form state and
  change event handler
  <hr />
  So we're taking the values property that's being passed and
  using it to set the values of these 2 inputs
  <hr />
  There's also this handleChange function that's automatically
  updating our state whenever a change event happens
  <hr />
  This seems to be working fine but what if we needed to access
  the form state data from outside of this form component?
</Notes>

---

### Problem: Data provided by render props has a limited scope (cont)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const AutoSaveForm = ({ saveToServer }) => {
  // Oops! We don't have access to `values` from here
  useTimeInterval(15000, () => saveToServer(values));

  return (
    <Form>
      {({ values, handleChange }) => <>...</>}
    </Form>
  );
};
```

<Notes>
  For example, let's imagine we wanted to use this Form component
  in an AutoSaveForm component that saves the users input
  occasionally
  <hr />
  It needs access to the form values in this API call but
  unfortunately it can't because we don't have access to values
  outside of the render prop function
</Notes>

---

### Solution: Provide instance methods or properties using a ref

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const Form = forwardRef(({ children }, forwardedRef) => {
  const ref = useRef();
  const [values, setValues] = useState({});

  useImperativeHandle(forwardedRef, () => ({
    element: ref.current,
    values
  }));

  return (
    <form ref={ref}>
      {children({ values, handleChange })}
    </form>
  );
});
```

<Notes>
  One way to work around this scope issue is by updating our Form
  component to attach an instance property to its ref
  <hr />
  So you can see here we're using React's useImperativeHandle
  hook to customize the ref value before forwarding it to
  consumers.
  <hr />
  We keep the reference to the DOM node and assign that to the
  element property just in case any consumers need it.
  <hr />
  Then we add a values property that contains the form state
  <hr />
  Also note that we're passing an object literal to the children
  prop here which is a bad idea because it will cause React to
  always rerender this component
  <hr />
  We could fix this by wrapping the object in useMemo before
  passing it along. So bonus points to anyone who caught that.
</Notes>

---

### Solution: Provide instance methods or properties using a ref (cont)

```jsx
const AutoSaveForm = ({ saveToServer }) => {
  const form = useRef();

  useTimeInterval(15000, () =>
    saveToServer(form.current.values)
  );

  return (
    <Form ref={form}>
      {({ values, handleChange }) => <>...</>}
    </Form>
  );
};
```

<Notes>
  Now we can update AutoSaveForm to use the instance property we
  attached to the ref in this useTimeInterval hook
  <hr />
  We do this by creating a ref, assigning it to the form
  component, and then accessing the ref's values property
</Notes>

# Useful Patterns

<Patterns active={4} patterns={patterns} />

### Problem: Complex compound component with a lot of intercommunication

<FiltersScreenshots />
<Notes>
  At Namely one of the design system components we worked on
  recently was a Filters dropdown. The dropdown contains a
  dynamic number of filter fields, a reset button, and an apply
  button (so it's basically a mini form in a dropdown).
  <hr />
  When the user hits apply, a number of things need to happen:
  <hr />
  The data in the form needs to get committed
  <hr />
  The dropdown needs to close
  <hr />
  These little filter status chips need to get rendered
  <hr />
  And of course the content needs to be filtered
  <hr />
  So there's a lot of intercommunication going on in this
  component. Data is being shared between a lot of different
  components and then rendered in several different places, and
  various parts of the component need to handle events.
  <hr />
  We could solve this by using a bunch of callback props that
  then get prop drilled but there's a much cleaner solution using
  context.
</Notes>

---

### Solution: Use context to pass a dispatch function

```jsx
const Filters = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(filtersReducer);

  return (
    <FiltersContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
      ...
    </FiltersContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

<Notes>
  First we use React's useReducer hook and pass the dispatch
  function to a context provider in the top-level component.
  <hr />
  This will allow any consumer to dispatch actions from anywhere
  within the compound component
</Notes>

---

### Solution: Use context to pass a dispatch function (cont)

```jsx
const FiltersToggle = () => {
  const dispatch = useContext(FiltersContext);

  const handleClick = useCallback(
    () => dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE_DROPDOWN' }),
    [dispatch]
  );

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Filters</Button>;
};
```

<Notes>
  Next we update one of the subcomponents to use the dispatch
  function.
  <hr />
  For example, here we have the main toggle button that opens and
  closes the dropdown.
  <hr />
  All we need to do to dispatch an action is to get the dispatch
  function from context and then call it in an event handler.
  <hr />
  We could repeat this simple setup in as many components as
  needed without increasing complexity further
  <hr />
  By sharing this dispatch function like this, we're able to
  utilize the flux pattern which we know, thanks to Redux, is
  great at grouping state changes in a single place
</Notes>

---

# Useful Patterns

<PatternsSummary patterns={patterns} />
<Notes>
  So we've gone over 4 different patterns that have helped us at
  Namely as we start to build more and more complicated
  components in our design system. Hopefully something I talked
  about today can help clean up some of your component APIs or
  just give you another option for passing around data in your
  applications.
